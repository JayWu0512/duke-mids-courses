# Duke IDS 706 â€“ Data Engineering Systems

This repository contains coursework, projects, and experiments for **IDS 706: Data Engineering Systems**, a core course in the Duke Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) program.

The course provides a **hands-on introduction to modern data engineering practices**, covering topics such as:

- Data modeling and pipelines
- SQL and relational databases
- Cloud-based data platforms
- Distributed systems and big data frameworks
- Data engineering for machine learning and analytics

The goal of this repo is to **document learning, share reproducible code, and track progress** throughout the course, while building practical skills in managing, transforming, and deploying data systems at scale.
